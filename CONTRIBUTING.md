- Which version do you used? You can find that in the `VERSION` file in the Mist folder
- What OS you're on?
- Provide a log file if necessary, you can find that in the Mist data folder (Linux: `~/.config/Mist/*.log`, Windows: `%APPDATA%/Roaming/Mist/*.log`, MacOSX: `~/Library/Application Support/Mist/*.log`)
